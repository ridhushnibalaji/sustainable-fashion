          <p>Every morning, we open our closets and pick out
            what to wear. Maybe you scroll online and see
            people post their GRWMs and OOTDs. But when was
            the last time you wondered where those clothes
            actually came from? The reality is that most of
            us don't. That shirt you threw on this morning
            and the jeans you've worn a hundred times are
            just part of your routine. While they may just
            be a small part of your life, the manufacturing
            process of textiles devastates our planet.</p>

      <h2>What is Sustainable Fashion?</h2>
        <div id="img-text">
          <p>Sustainable fashion is clothing that's designed, manufactured, and distributed in a way
          that is environmentally friendly and responsible. The rise of fast fashion has contributed
          to a growing waste crisis, as well as the depletion of natural resources because of its
          promotion of rapid production and disposable clothing. The movement towards sustainability
          is about creating a system for clothing that can work long-term without wasting resources or
          abusing people. While awareness of sustainability grows, balancing personal style,
          affordability, and environmental responsibility can be hard. Even so, there are actions you
          can take in your daily lives to support this cause.</p>

				  <summary>Thrifting</summary>
          <p>With old trends coming back into fashion, thrifting is a popular way to find clothes you
            want without buying newly made ones. Thrift shops sell clothing from donations, surplus
            from retailers and manufacturers, charity drives, and auctions. This is why you can find a
            variety of styles and brands in them, even rare designer items.</p>

        <details>
				  <summary>Donate or Recycle Old Clothes</summary>
          <p>Instead of throwing away clothes you no longer wear, consider donating or recycling them.
            Giving your clothes a second life not only helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up
            in landfills, but it also supports people in need. Worn-out fabrics can be turned into new
            materials, keeping them in use and reducing the demand for new resources.</p>
				</details>
        <details>
				  <summary>Organic Materials & Sustainable Brands</summary>
          <p>Buying clothing made from brands that use organic materials, is a great way to be more
            sustainable. Look for certifications to make sure they are eco-friendly and pay fair wages
            to workers. Organic fabrics are grown without harmful chemicals or pesticides, which helps
            protect soil, water, and wildlife. They’re also softer on the skin and last longer than
            other fabrics. Support brands that make sure each step of the process is safe.</p>

				  <summary>DIY & Upcycling</summary>
          <p>A great alternative to buying new clothes is upcycling. You can revamp your old or boring
            clothes by sewing them differently, adding extra elements, or fixing the size/holes. Basic
            sewing skills can go a long way! This lets you make your closet more unique without spending 
            much money. There are DIYs online that show tutorials on how to add prints to shirts, paint
            jeans, and so many more options. Upcycling not only reduces waste but also allows you to
            express your personal style in a sustainable way. </p>

        <details>
				  <summary>Media Literacy</summary>
          <p>Media literacy is all about understanding and questioning the messages we see in
            advertising and social media. Learning to recognize how brands influence trends and consumer
            choices helps you make more conscious decisions about what you buy. Ask yourself how often
            you'll wear something before you buy it. Try not to buy things off impulse or microtrends
            and pay attention to misleading ads.</p>
